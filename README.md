# Semantics
NLP project on Semantics

Implementic some concepts from formal semantics using C++ (Generalised quantifiers, relations).
This project is for the college module 'Intermediate programming & Natural Language processing'.
Most code written by Dr. Martin Emms (https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Martin.Emms/), 
added to by myself and Benno Krojer (https://github.com/BennoKrojer).


Possible additions:
- numbers e.g. "5 students like maths." ...done
- ditransitive verbs
- passive
- adjectives, general ("Hermione is a female student") or noun-specific ("Hermione is a good runner")
- infering reflexive/symmetric/transitive relations (in our database we know that Peter is married to Mary. We can infer that "Mary is married to Peter" is true as well.)
- quantifying the object e.g. "Harry likes every subject"
